        "In this module, I used spaCy to perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging on each article. POS tagging helps identify the grammatical role of each word — such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs — which is useful for understanding writing style and linguistic patterns.\n",

        "**Why It Matters:**\n",
        "- Reveals how different categories (e.g., Sports vs. Politics) use language differently\n",
        "- Helps detect patterns like action-heavy verbs in sports or formal nouns in politics\n",
        "- Supports downstream tasks like syntax parsing and sentiment analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Each article now includes a dictionary of POS counts, showing how often each type of word appears. This adds a layer of linguistic insight to the NewsBot system.\n"

$155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. the deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of enron s shareholders almost three years ago. so far  including the latest deal  just under $500m (\\u00a3378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.  however  the latest deal does not include former enron chief executives ken lay and jeff skilling. both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm s collapse. neither does it cover andrew fastow  who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. enron s shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions jp morgan chase  citigroup  merrill lynch and credit suisse first boston. the university of california said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in october 2006. it joined the lawsuit in december 2001alleging  massive insider trading  and fraud  claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.\",\n          \"bbc poll indicates economic gloom citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a bbc world service poll believe the world economy is worsening.  most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. but when asked about their own family s financial outlook  a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. almost 23 000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll  which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster. the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill  compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. those surveyed in three countries were split. in percentage terms  an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse  compared to 34% who said it was improving. similarly  48% were pessimistic about their national economy  while 41% were optimistic. and 47% saw their family s economic conditions improving  as against 36% who said they were getting worse.  the poll of 22 953 people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan  together with the program on international policy attitudes (pipa) at the university of maryland.  while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago  people seem to not have fully absorbed this development  though they are personally experiencing its effects   said pipa director steven kull.  people around the world are saying:  i m ok  but the world isn t .  there may be a perception that war  terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place  even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance  says the bbc s elizabeth blunt.  the countries where people were most optimistic  both for the world and for their own families  were two fast-growing developing economies  china and india  followed by indonesia. china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth  which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale  says the bbc s louisa lim in beijing. but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country s rosy economic future  our correspondent says. south korea was the most pessimistic  while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy. the bbc s david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001  which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents  families  but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. pipa conducted the poll from 15 november 2004 to 3 january 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005. the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points  depending on the country. in eight of the countries  the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pos_tags\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

$155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. the deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of enron s shareholders almost three years ago. so far  including the latest deal  just under $500m (\\u00a3378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.  however  the latest deal does not include former enron chief executives ken lay and jeff skilling. both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm s collapse. neither does it cover andrew fastow  who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. enron s shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions jp morgan chase  citigroup  merrill lynch and credit suisse first boston. the university of california said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in october 2006. it joined the lawsuit in december 2001alleging  massive insider trading  and fraud  claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.\",\n          \"bbc poll indicates economic gloom citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a bbc world service poll believe the world economy is worsening.  most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. but when asked about their own family s financial outlook  a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. almost 23 000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll  which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster. the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill  compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. those surveyed in three countries were split. in percentage terms  an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse  compared to 34% who said it was improving. similarly  48% were pessimistic about their national economy  while 41% were optimistic. and 47% saw their family s economic conditions improving  as against 36% who said they were getting worse.  the poll of 22 953 people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan  together with the program on international policy attitudes (pipa) at the university of maryland.  while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago  people seem to not have fully absorbed this development  though they are personally experiencing its effects   said pipa director steven kull.  people around the world are saying:  i m ok  but the world isn t .  there may be a perception that war  terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place  even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance  says the bbc s elizabeth blunt.  the countries where people were most optimistic  both for the world and for their own families  were two fast-growing developing economies  china and india  followed by indonesia. china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth  which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale  says the bbc s louisa lim in beijing. but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country s rosy economic future  our correspondent says. south korea was the most pessimistic  while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy. the bbc s david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001  which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents  families  but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. pipa conducted the poll from 15 november 2004 to 3 january 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005. the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points  depending on the country. in eight of the countries  the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dependencies\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

$155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. the deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of enron s shareholders almost three years ago. so far  including the latest deal  just under $500m (\\u00a3378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.  however  the latest deal does not include former enron chief executives ken lay and jeff skilling. both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm s collapse. neither does it cover andrew fastow  who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. enron s shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions jp morgan chase  citigroup  merrill lynch and credit suisse first boston. the university of california said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in october 2006. it joined the lawsuit in december 2001alleging  massive insider trading  and fraud  claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.\",\n          \"bbc poll indicates economic gloom citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a bbc world service poll believe the world economy is worsening.  most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. but when asked about their own family s financial outlook  a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. almost 23 000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll  which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster. the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill  compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. those surveyed in three countries were split. in percentage terms  an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse  compared to 34% who said it was improving. similarly  48% were pessimistic about their national economy  while 41% were optimistic. and 47% saw their family s economic conditions improving  as against 36% who said they were getting worse.  the poll of 22 953 people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan  together with the program on international policy attitudes (pipa) at the university of maryland.  while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago  people seem to not have fully absorbed this development  though they are personally experiencing its effects   said pipa director steven kull.  people around the world are saying:  i m ok  but the world isn t .  there may be a perception that war  terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place  even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance  says the bbc s elizabeth blunt.  the countries where people were most optimistic  both for the world and for their own families  were two fast-growing developing economies  china and india  followed by indonesia. china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth  which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale  says the bbc s louisa lim in beijing. but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country s rosy economic future  our correspondent says. south korea was the most pessimistic  while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy. the bbc s david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001  which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents  families  but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. pipa conducted the poll from 15 november 2004 to 3 january 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005. the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points  depending on the country. in eight of the countries  the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.0482160306921469,\n        \"min\": -0.9884,\n        \"max\": 0.9887,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9209,\n          -0.9393,\n          -0.9468\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

$155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. the deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of enron s shareholders almost three years ago. so far  including the latest deal  just under $500m (\\u00a3378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.  however  the latest deal does not include former enron chief executives ken lay and jeff skilling. both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm s collapse. neither does it cover andrew fastow  who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. enron s shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions jp morgan chase  citigroup  merrill lynch and credit suisse first boston. the university of california said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in october 2006. it joined the lawsuit in december 2001alleging  massive insider trading  and fraud  claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.\",\n          \"bbc poll indicates economic gloom citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a bbc world service poll believe the world economy is worsening.  most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. but when asked about their own family s financial outlook  a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. almost 23 000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll  which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster. the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill  compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. those surveyed in three countries were split. in percentage terms  an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse  compared to 34% who said it was improving. similarly  48% were pessimistic about their national economy  while 41% were optimistic. and 47% saw their family s economic conditions improving  as against 36% who said they were getting worse.  the poll of 22 953 people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan  together with the program on international policy attitudes (pipa) at the university of maryland.  while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago  people seem to not have fully absorbed this development  though they are personally experiencing its effects   said pipa director steven kull.  people around the world are saying:  i m ok  but the world isn t .  there may be a perception that war  terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place  even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance  says the bbc s elizabeth blunt.  the countries where people were most optimistic  both for the world and for their own families  were two fast-growing developing economies  china and india  followed by indonesia. china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth  which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale  says the bbc s louisa lim in beijing. but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country s rosy economic future  our correspondent says. south korea was the most pessimistic  while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy. the bbc s david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001  which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents  families  but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. pipa conducted the poll from 15 november 2004 to 3 january 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005. the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points  depending on the country. in eight of the countries  the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entities\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
